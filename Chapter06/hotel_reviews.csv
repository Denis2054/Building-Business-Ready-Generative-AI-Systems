We got a nice hotel. The parking was rather expensive. However, we got a good deal for my birthday. We arrived in during the night because of a late flight but the parking was open 24hours The check in was rapid. The room was a large size. Cool. But we didn't get the view expected. The bed was super comfortable and got a nice sleep for a few hours but then there was a raucous of a noisy crowd going to bed late. Anyway, the price was acceptable and we made it to the shopping mall next to the hotel which reminded me of the one we had at home.,3
An absolutely flawless experience from start to finish. The valet was courteous, check-in was a breeze, and they even upgraded us to a suite with a breathtaking city view. The room was spotless, the bed felt like sleeping on a cloud, and the complimentary breakfast was restaurant-quality. It's expensive, but you get what you pay for. We will definitely be back.,5
The location is the best thing about this hotel. It's right in the heart of downtown, walking distance to everything. However, the hotel itself is quite dated. The furniture in our room was scuffed, and the bathroom felt like it hadn't been updated since the 90s. The staff were polite but seemed overworked. It was fine for one night, but I wouldn't stay longer.,3
I was really disappointed with our stay. The online pictures must be from a decade ago. Our room had a musty smell, the wallpaper was peeling in the corner, and the air conditioner was so loud we had to turn it off to sleep. We asked to switch rooms, but they said they were fully booked. The only saving grace was the attached coffee shop.,2
This place is a hidden gem! We booked it last minute and were so pleasantly surprised. The staff treated us like royalty. The room was modern, clean, and surprisingly quiet given its central location. The rooftop pool and bar area was fantastic. Excellent value for the money.,5
A decent hotel for a business trip. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, the desk in the room was spacious, and the location was perfect for my meetings. The room was on the smaller side and lacked character, but it was clean and functional. The gym was well-equipped. No major complaints, but also nothing special.,4
DO NOT STAY HERE. Our reservation was lost, and it took them nearly an hour to find us a room. When we finally got in, the sheets were stained, and there was trash in the bin from the previous guest. We complained to the manager who was incredibly rude and dismissive. We checked out immediately and found another hotel. A complete disaster.,1
We had a wonderful family vacation here. The hotel is very kid-friendly, with a great pool area and a game room. Our suite had a separate living area, which was perfect for us. The location next to the theme park was unbeatable. The on-site restaurant was a bit pricey, but the food was delicious.,5
It was... okay. The check-in was slow, and the staff didn't seem very welcoming. The room was clean enough, but the bathroom was tiny - I could barely turn around in the shower. The bed was comfortable, which was a plus. For the price we paid, I was expecting a bit more.,3
A solid, reliable choice. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfortable, and the blackout curtains worked wonders. We didn't interact much with the staff, but the check-in and check-out process was efficient. The parking garage was a bit tight to navigate. A good, no-frills option.,4
This was a terrible experience. The noise from the street was unbearable all night long, even with the windows closed. The room was tiny and cramped. When we tried to use the shower in the morning, there was no hot water. We called the front desk, and they just said they'd 'look into it.' We ended up leaving without showering. Avoid at all costs.,1
My stay was mostly positive. The hotel has a beautiful, historic lobby that's very impressive. My room was charming and well-appointed, though the floorboards were a bit creaky. The staff at the concierge desk were incredibly helpful with recommendations for dinner. My only issue was that the elevator was very slow.,4
The hotel is in a great spot, just a short walk from the beach. Our room had a balcony with a partial ocean view, which was nice. However, the room felt a bit worn out, and the air conditioning struggled to keep the room cool. The pool area was always crowded and we could never find a chair. It was an average stay.,3
Perfect for a solo traveler on a budget. The room was small, as expected, but it was very clean and had everything I needed. The shared bathroom facilities were also kept very clean. The staff were friendly and gave me a great map of the city. The location was fantastic, right next to a major subway station. Can't beat the price.,4
I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the modern feel of the hotel. The check-in was automated via a kiosk, which was fast and efficient. The room was well-designed to maximize space. The bed was extremely comfortable. My only complaint is the lack of a coffee maker in the room; you had to go down to the lobby.,4
This felt like a scam. The 'resort fee' they add on at the end is ridiculous and covers nothing of value. The room was shabby, and the 'view' was of a brick wall. We could hear every word from the conversation in the next room. The staff were indifferent. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.,2
What a charming boutique hotel! The decor was unique and stylish. The staff were so warm and welcoming, and even offered us a glass of wine upon arrival. Our room was beautiful, with a very comfortable four-poster bed. The breakfast delivered to our room was a lovely touch. A truly special place.,5
The hotel served its purpose for a one-night layover. It's very close to the airport and the free shuttle service was prompt. The room was basic and showed some wear and tear, but it was clean. The walls were thin, and I was woken up a few times by people in the hallway. It's a convenient, but not luxurious, option.,3
Absolutely terrible service. The front desk staff acted like we were inconveniencing them by checking in. We had to call three times to get extra pillows sent to the room. The restaurant staff were equally unfriendly. The hotel itself might be nice, but the attitude of the employees ruined the entire experience.,2
We loved our stay here. The hotel is beautiful, with a grand, elegant feel. Our room was spacious, quiet, and had a lovely view of the park. We used the spa facilities, which were top-notch. It was a luxurious and relaxing weekend getaway. Highly recommend for a special occasion.,5
The staff went above and beyond. My flight was cancelled and I had to book a room at 1 AM. They were incredibly accommodating and empathetic. The room was pristine and the bed was exactly what I needed after a stressful day. I'm so grateful for their kindness.,5
The hotel is fine, but the neighborhood felt a bit unsafe at night. The room itself was clean and the lock was sturdy, but I wouldn't recommend it for families or solo female travelers. The price was low, but I'd pay more for peace of mind next time.,2
A perfectly adequate stay. Nothing to write home about. The room was clean, the bed was fine, the shower worked. It's a place to sleep, and it does that job without any fuss. The location was a bit far from the city center, but public transport was close.,3
Horrible. The room reeked of stale cigarette smoke, despite being a 'non-smoking' room. The carpet had several suspicious stains. I slept in my clothes because I didn't trust the cleanliness of the bed. I checked out first thing in the morning. Never again.,1
The free breakfast was surprisingly good! They had a waffle maker, fresh fruit, and a good selection of pastries. It saved us a lot of money. The rest of the hotel was standard, but the great breakfast made it a good value.,4
I booked a room with a king bed and was given a room with two double beds. When I pointed this out, the staff was unhelpful and said there was nothing they could do. The room was also right next to the ice machine, which was very loud. Poor service.,2
This is a pet-friendly hotel, and they really mean it! They had a dog bed and water bowl waiting in our room for our furry friend. There's a nice park right across the street for walks. It was so nice to find a place that truly welcomes pets.,5
The walls are paper-thin. I could hear the television in the next room and a baby crying down the hall all night. I barely got any sleep. The room was otherwise fine, but the noise level was unacceptable.,2
The hotel's aesthetic was very cool and modern. Lots of great art in the lobby and hallways. Our room had a minimalist design which I appreciated. The bar downstairs had fantastic cocktails. A great spot for a younger crowd.,4
For the price, you can't beat it. Is it the fanciest hotel? No. But the room was clean, the staff was friendly, the location was convenient, and it didn't break the bank. It's a great option for budget-conscious travelers.,4
Our key card stopped working three times during our two-night stay. Each time we had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get it reactivated. It was a huge inconvenience. The staff didn't seem to care.,2
The view from our balcony was stunning. We could see the entire mountain range. We spent every morning and evening out there. The room itself was nice, but the view is what made this stay unforgettable.,5
The parking situation is a nightmare. The garage is tiny and always full. We had to park in a public lot three blocks away and drag our luggage. The hotel should have a better system or at least warn guests in advance.,2
Exceptional customer service. The concierge helped us book dinner reservations at a very popular restaurant and gave us perfect directions for getting around the city. Every staff member we encountered was smiling and helpful.,5
The room was much smaller than it appeared online. We were constantly bumping into each other. The bathroom was also cramped with very little counter space. It felt claustrophobic. The location was good, but I need more space.,3
The hotel pool was the highlight. It was clean, large, and had plenty of lounge chairs. The poolside service for drinks and snacks was a great touch. We spent most of our days just relaxing by the pool.,4
Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at the designated check-in time. We had to wait in the lobby for over an hour. They offered us a free drink at the bar, but it was still a frustrating start to our vacation.,3
An old hotel with a lot of charm. You can feel the history in the building. The floors creak and the elevator is old-fashioned, but that's part of the experience. It was like stepping back in time. We loved it.,4
The hidden fees are outrageous. On top of the room rate, there was a 'resort fee,' a 'service fee,' and an expensive charge for Wi-Fi. It ended up being almost double the advertised price. It felt very dishonest.,1
Simply perfect. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, everything was handled with professionalism and care. The room was immaculate, the amenities were luxurious, and the atmosphere was peaceful. A five-star experience all the way.,5
The room smelled like bleach. It was so strong it gave me a headache. While I appreciate that they clean, they need to air out the rooms properly. It was very unpleasant.,2
Great location for attending a conference at the nearby convention center. You can walk there in 5 minutes. The hotel is clearly geared towards business travelers and it does that well. No fuss, just efficiency.,4
Booked this for the hot tub, but it was 'out of order' for our entire stay. This was the main reason we chose this hotel, so it was a huge letdown. They should have noted this on their website.,2
The hotel is right on the river, and the riverwalk path is beautiful. We rented bikes from the hotel and had a lovely afternoon exploring. The room had a nice view of the water. Very relaxing.,4
This place was filthy. There was dust on every surface and a used coffee cup on the nightstand. The bathroom was disgusting. I have photographic evidence. We complained and were moved to another room that was only marginally better.,1
The staff was incredibly friendly and remembered our names. They always had a smile and a greeting for us. It made the stay feel very personal and welcoming. Little things like that make a big difference.,5
The decor is very dated and bizarre. Lots of floral patterns and pastel colors. It felt like staying at my grandmother's house, and not in a good way. The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation.,2
The continental breakfast was pathetic. Just some stale cereal and a few sad-looking apples. They ran out of coffee 30 minutes before it was scheduled to end. Don't count on it for a real meal.,2
We were on our honeymoon and they made it so special. There was a bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for us in the room. It was such a thoughtful gesture. We will never forget our stay.,5
The Wi-Fi was so slow it was unusable. I couldn't even load my emails. In this day and age, a hotel needs to provide reliable internet, especially when they charge for it. I had to use my phone's hotspot.,2
Amazing gym! They had a wide variety of modern equipment, free weights, and even Peloton bikes. It's one of the best hotel gyms I've ever used. A huge plus for me.,5
We were placed in a room directly across from the elevators. We could hear them dinging and people talking at all hours of the night. It was impossible to get a good night's sleep. Always ask for a room far from the elevator.,2
The rooftop bar has the best views in the city. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, you should go there for a drink at sunset. The cocktails were expensive but worth it for the ambiance and scenery.,4
The water pressure in the shower was terrible. It was just a weak trickle. It took forever to wash the shampoo out of my hair. A simple fix that would make a big difference.,3
This is a classic, grand old hotel. The lobby is magnificent and the ballroom is breathtaking. It's not the most modern place, but it has an elegance and character that new hotels can't match.,4
I left my phone charger in the room and called the hotel as soon as I realized. The housekeeping staff found it and the front desk mailed it to my home address. I was so relieved and grateful for their honesty and help.,5
The hotel restaurant was surprisingly fantastic. We ate there on our first night because we were tired and it ended up being one of the best meals of our trip. The chef is very talented.,5
There was construction going on in the hotel during our stay. The noise started at 8 AM every morning, including Saturday. It would have been nice to be warned about this when we booked.,3
The beds were rock hard. It felt like sleeping on a board. Both my husband and I woke up with sore backs every morning. We couldn't wait to get back to our own bed.,2
A great, no-nonsense motel. Park right outside your door. The room was clean, the AC was cold, and the price was right. Perfect for a road trip stopover.,4
The lighting in the bathroom was so dim it was difficult to put on makeup. They need to install brighter bulbs. It's a small detail, but an annoying one.,3
I had an issue with my bill at checkout, and the manager, Sarah, was incredibly patient and helpful. She took the time to explain every charge and resolved the discrepancy with a professional and kind attitude. Excellent management.,5
The location is terrible unless you have a car. It's in an industrial park with nothing around. You can't walk to any restaurants or shops. The pictures make it look much more appealing than it is.,2
We got a great deal on a 'mystery' hotel booking, and this is where we ended up. We were thrilled! It was a high-end hotel that we would never have been able to afford otherwise. Clean, comfortable, and a little bit of luxury.,5
The soundproofing is excellent. Our room faced a busy street, but once the window was closed, we couldn't hear a thing. We slept soundly every night. A huge plus for a city hotel.,4
The room was so dark and dreary. The only window faced an alley and got no natural light. The decor was all dark browns and grays. It was a bit depressing to spend time in.,2
They offer a complimentary shuttle to anywhere within a 3-mile radius. This was so convenient! It saved us a lot of money on ride-sharing services. The drivers were also very friendly and knowledgeable about the area.,5
The room had a strange, sweet smell that we couldn't identify. We tried opening the window, but it didn't help. It wasn't overpowering, but it was persistent and a little nauseating.,3
The in-room minibar prices are criminal. $8 for a bottle of water? It's pure extortion. Just walk to the convenience store down the street.,2
The hotel is built around a beautiful courtyard with a fountain. It was a lovely, peaceful place to sit and read a book. Our room had a balcony overlooking it. A very serene atmosphere.,4
My keycard failed and I was locked out of my room at 2 AM. It took over 30 minutes for someone from security to come and let me in. I was standing in the hallway in my pajamas. Not a great experience.,2
This hotel is all about the location. It's steps from the main square, museums, and restaurants. We didn't need a taxi once. You're paying for convenience, and for us, it was worth it.,4
The carpet in our room was damp near the air conditioning unit. We reported it, and they sent someone from maintenance, but he just said it was 'condensation' and did nothing. It felt unsanitary.,2
The staff at the breakfast buffet were amazing. They kept everything stocked, cleared plates quickly, and were so cheerful. They worked incredibly hard and made the morning rush a pleasant experience.,5
There's no elevator. We had to carry our heavy suitcases up three flights of stairs. This should be made very clear on the booking website, especially for guests with mobility issues.,2
The pool was closed for a private event for one of the full days we were there. This was a major disappointment as we had planned to spend the afternoon relaxing by the pool. Guests should get priority.,3
This place is an institution. It's been around forever and has hosted countless famous people. The history is fascinating. It may be a little worn around the edges, but it's an iconic place to stay.,4
Our flight home was late at night, and they allowed us a late checkout at 4 PM for a very reasonable fee. This made our last day so much more relaxing. We really appreciated the flexibility.,5
The entire hotel felt grimy. The elevator buttons were sticky, the handrails were dirty, and our room just didn't feel clean. I was constantly using hand sanitizer. It needs a deep cleaning.,1
The free cookies at check-in were a nice touch. It's a small thing, but it made me smile after a long day of travel. The room was standard but clean.,4
I specifically requested a quiet room and was placed right next to a family with three young, screaming children. The walls were thin. I complained but they said no other rooms were available. Terrible.,2
The hotel has its own movie theater that shows classic films. We watched one on a rainy afternoon and it was a unique and enjoyable amenity. Popcorn was free!,5
The bathroom sink had a slow drain. By the time I was done brushing my teeth, it was full of water. It was gross. Maintenance should have caught this.,2
This place is a party hotel. If you're looking for a quiet, relaxing stay, go elsewhere. The music from the lobby bar thumps until 2 AM. Great for a bachelor party, bad for a family.,3
I loved the heated floors in the bathroom. It was such a luxurious feeling on a cold morning. The rest of the room was also very well-appointed and modern.,5
The front desk clerk gave us a terrible restaurant recommendation. The food was overpriced and mediocre. We should have just checked online reviews ourselves. Don't trust their 'local knowledge'.,3
The bed was incredibly comfortable, but the pillows were flat and lifeless. It was like sleeping on a folded-up towel. We asked for more, but they were all the same. Invest in better pillows!,3
There was a power outage in the middle of the night. The emergency lights came on, but the AC did not. It got very hot and stuffy. It wasn't the hotel's fault, but it made for an uncomfortable night.,3
The housekeeping staff was so thorough. They not only cleaned the room perfectly but also neatly organized our toiletries on the counter and folded the clothes we'd left on a chair. It was above and beyond.,5
The advertised 'ocean view' was a joke. If I stood on the balcony and craned my neck all the way to the left, I could see a tiny sliver of blue between two other buildings. Very misleading.,2
The hotel offers free yoga classes in the morning. I attended one and it was a wonderful way to start the day. The instructor was excellent. A great wellness amenity.,5
There was a weird, intermittent beeping sound in our room that we could never locate. It would happen every few minutes and was just loud enough to be annoying. It drove us crazy.,3
The concierge was a lifesaver. He managed to get us last-minute tickets to a sold-out show. He was incredibly resourceful and well-connected. Truly a miracle worker.,5
The room was decorated with modern art, but it was all a bit strange and unsettling. One painting in particular looked like a horror movie poster. It wasn't relaxing at all.,3
The hotel's mobile app was very useful. We could check in, unlock our door, and order room service all from our phones. Very convenient and tech-forward.,4
I found a bug in my salad at the hotel cafe. I quietly pointed it out to the waiter, and he was very apologetic and comped our entire meal. They handled it well, but it shouldn't have happened.,2
The hotel is located in a very charming, historic neighborhood. We spent hours just walking around and admiring the architecture. Much better than staying in a generic downtown area.,4
The air in the room was incredibly dry. I woke up every morning with a sore throat and dry nose. They need to install humidifiers, especially in the winter.,3
The service at the pool bar was extremely slow. It took 20 minutes to get a server's attention, and another 20 minutes to get our drinks. They were clearly understaffed.,2
A fantastic eco-friendly hotel. They have composting and recycling in every room, use bulk dispensers for toiletries to reduce plastic waste, and have energy-efficient lighting. I appreciate their commitment to sustainability.,5
The TV remote was sticky and gross. It was clear it hadn't been wiped down in a long time. It makes you wonder what else they aren't cleaning properly.,2
The business center was a great asset. I had to print and scan some documents for work, and their facilities were modern and easy to use. Very helpful for a work trip.,4
The room had a connecting door to the adjacent room, and it was not soundproof at all. We could hear the entire conversation of our neighbors. It felt like they were in the room with us.,2
The hotel provided complimentary bikes, which was awesome. We spent a day biking all over the city and had a blast. It's a great perk that more hotels should offer.,5
The fire alarm went off at 3 AM. It was a false alarm, but it was a terrifying way to wake up. It took a long time for them to give the all-clear. It completely ruined my night's sleep.,2
The bathtub was enormous and had jacuzzi jets. It was the perfect way to relax after a long day of walking. I took a bath every single night of our stay.,5
They charge for every little thing. Want to use the in-room safe? That's a fee. Want to receive a package? That's a fee. It feels like they are trying to nickel and dime you at every turn.,2
The hotel has a 'no-tipping' policy, as staff are paid a higher wage. This created a much more relaxed atmosphere. The service was still excellent, driven by professionalism rather than the expectation of a tip.,5
The room had a fully equipped kitchenette, which was great. We were able to make our own breakfast and store leftovers from dinner. It saved us a lot of money on food.,4
The hallways were dark and smelled faintly of mildew. It was not a welcoming first impression when walking to our room. They need to improve the ventilation and lighting.,2
The front desk staff were fluent in several languages. As an international traveler, this was incredibly helpful and made the check-in process smooth and stress-free.,4
The hotel is located right next to a busy hospital. We heard ambulance sirens at all hours of the day and night. It was very disruptive to our peace and quiet.,3
The art in the lobby was for sale from local artists. It was a great way to showcase local talent and created a unique, gallery-like atmosphere. We even bought a small piece.,4
The room was advertised as having a 'sofa bed,' but it was just a lumpy, uncomfortable couch that did not pull out. My son had to sleep on it and he was miserable. False advertising.,1
The doormen were fantastic. They always had a smile, helped with luggage and taxis, and gave great advice. They were the friendly face of the hotel and made a great impression.,5
The hotel provided a noise machine in the room, which was a thoughtful touch. It helped drown out the city sounds and allowed us to sleep more peacefully.,4
The temperature control in the room was impossible to figure out. It was either freezing cold or boiling hot. We could never get it to a comfortable temperature.,3
The hotel's garden was a beautiful, tranquil oasis in the middle of the city. We enjoyed our morning coffee there every day. It felt a world away from the urban hustle.,5
The shower curtain had mold on it. It was disgusting. We asked for a new one, but it's a basic cleanliness issue that should never happen in the first place.,1
The free shuttle to the airport only runs once an hour. We ended up having to take a taxi because the shuttle schedule didn't align with our flight time.,3
The hotel had a lending library in the lobby where you could borrow books and board games. It was a cozy and fun amenity that we took advantage of on a rainy day.,4
The check-in line was incredibly long. We waited for over 45 minutes just to get our room key. They need more staff at the front desk during peak hours.,2
The room service menu was extensive and the food arrived hot and delicious. We ordered a late-night snack and it was perfect. A bit pricey, but worth it for the convenience.,4
The hotel is currently undergoing renovations, and our room was right next to the work area. We were woken up by drilling and hammering at 8am. They should not be booking these rooms.,2
The gym was tiny and had only a few old machines. The pictures online made it look much larger and better equipped. Very disappointing for someone who likes to work out while traveling.,2
The hotel offered a free walking tour of the neighborhood. The guide was knowledgeable and funny, and it was a great way to get our bearings and learn about the local history.,5
Our room's window faced the hotel's trash and recycling area. We were treated to the sounds of clanging bottles and garbage trucks early in the morning. Not a pleasant wake-up call.,2
The hotel bar had a great happy hour with half-priced drinks and appetizers. It was a popular spot and had a fun, lively atmosphere every evening.,4
The hotel's 'business center' consisted of a single, ancient computer and a printer that was out of ink. It was completely useless. Don't rely on it if you need to get work done.,1
The staff remembered that it was my birthday and surprised me with a cupcake and a card signed by the team. It was an incredibly sweet and personal gesture that made my day.,5
The towels were thin, scratchy, and had seen better days. It's a small thing, but luxurious, fluffy towels are one of the best parts of staying in a nice hotel.,3
The hotel's location on a steep hill was a challenge. Walking back after a long day was a serious workout. It's not suitable for anyone with mobility issues.,3
The room had a high-quality Bluetooth speaker that we could connect our phones to. It was great for listening to music while getting ready. A nice, modern touch.,4
I accidentally left a valuable item in the room safe. I called the hotel in a panic, and they were incredibly helpful. They secured the item and arranged for it to be shipped to me overnight. I am so grateful.,5
The hotel restaurant was fully booked, and they wouldn't prioritize hotel guests for a table. We had to go out and find somewhere else to eat, which was frustrating after a long day.,3
The bed linens were luxurious. High thread count, soft, and smelled wonderful. I had an amazing night's sleep. They clearly invest in quality bedding.,5
The 'free' Wi-Fi was only for one device per room. If you wanted to connect a second phone or a laptop, you had to pay an extra fee. This policy is ridiculous and outdated.,2
The hotel is supposedly haunted, and they lean into it with ghost tours and spooky stories. It was a fun and unique theme, even if we didn't see any ghosts ourselves.,4
The room's air conditioner was leaking water onto the carpet. We had to put a towel down to soak it up. Maintenance never came to fix it during our stay.,2
The valet parking was extremely expensive, but it was the only option. There was no self-parking available nearby. It felt like they were taking advantage of the situation.,2
The hotel offers cooking classes with their head chef. We signed up and it was the highlight of our trip. We learned to make a local dish and had a fantastic meal. A wonderful experience.,5
The room was very spacious, with a separate sitting area and a huge closet. We had plenty of room to spread out and unpack, which made our long stay very comfortable.,4
The hotel's commitment to hiring local staff was evident. Everyone we met was from the area and genuinely proud of their city, offering authentic and heartfelt recommendations.,5
The bathroom had a heated towel rack. Getting out of the shower to a warm towel was a small but wonderful luxury. It's the little details that count.,4
The ice machine on our floor was broken. We had to go up two floors just to get ice for our drinks. A minor inconvenience, but still annoying.,3
The hotel is located in the theater district, which was perfect for our trip. We could walk to our show and there were plenty of great pre-theater dinner options nearby.,5
The room's decor was trying too hard to be trendy and it just ended up looking cheap. The furniture felt flimsy and the 'art' looked like it came from a big-box store.,2
The hotel had a fantastic kids' club. Our children begged to go every day. It gave us a few hours of adult time, and they had a blast with the planned activities.,5
The water in the shower would fluctuate between scalding hot and ice cold without warning. It was impossible to have a relaxing shower. It felt dangerous.,1
The hotel provided a list of recommended jogging routes, complete with maps and distances. As a runner, I found this incredibly helpful for my morning workouts.,4
The room had a Nespresso machine with a variety of pods. It was so much better than the standard, mediocre hotel coffee. A great way to start the day.,4
The elevator was out of service for our entire stay. We were on the 5th floor. We got a lot of exercise, but it was not what we signed up for. They offered no discount.,2
The hotel's rooftop infinity pool was absolutely breathtaking. The views were incredible and it was the perfect place to relax and soak up the sun. Pure luxury.,5
The room had a foul odor, like old, wet socks. We complained and they sent someone to spray air freshener, which just made it smell like foul, wet, flowery socks.,1
The staff at the front desk seemed bored and uninterested. They barely made eye contact during check-in and offered no information about the hotel or its amenities.,2
The hotel is located directly on a public beach. We could walk out the back door and be on the sand in seconds. The location could not have been better.,5
The 'king bed' was just two twin beds pushed together. There was an uncomfortable lump in the middle and the beds kept separating. It was not a true king bed.,2
