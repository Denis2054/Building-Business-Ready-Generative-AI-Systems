1. The link for this code is not available yet.     
Status:¬† I suppose it will when the repo becomes public. This is the code repository for¬†Building Business-Ready Generative AI Systems, First Edition, published by Packt.
    
2. The about section was empty    
Status: I filled it in. Please check.   

3. The About the Book section did not fit the Preface I just updated.     
Status: I updated it. Check with Tanya, please.   

4. Kaggle is missing from the programs of the chapter list.   
Status: I assume this will be done when you check the code       

5. Versions table    
Status: I filled it in and revised the text below it.    

7. requirements3 is not used     
Status: When I control the repository before making it public, I will delete it after ensuring it is never accessed.   

8. I'm the only author   
Status: I changed the text to:¬†Get to know the Author

9. Bottom content. The author's paragraph was ok. But the links didn't work in the other related books section.    ¬†
Status: I added an icon to the Author section and wrote the Other related books section with the books that I see as necessary: my book on RAG because I deal with RAG in this book. My 3rd Edition of Transformers, because this book is built on that franchise and RAG.    

10. Infos:     
a) I added this control log with a date to the CHANGELOG and will remove it when the repo goes public     
b) I'll save and remove the CODELOG when the repo goes publicPlease read it before verifying the code.
