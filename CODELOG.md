Last update June 27, 2025

This codelog contains the author's notes when addressing the TR comments on **Building-Business-Ready-Generative-AI-Systems** repository.   
üê¨ Indicates *new notes since last update* 

The notes are organized by theme.

## [1.Google Colab]
The strategic choice of Google Colab for this book was for the user to be able to open a notebook in one click on GitHub while reading the book.
Once the requested API keys are configured (OpenAI, Pinecone), the user can run the notebooks with one click.
*Goal*: Focus on the complexity of the Generative AI Systems. 

The readers are free to install the programs in whatever environment they wish.

## [2.Python]
This book is *not for beginners." As such, there is no need to explain what numpy, matplotlib or any other Python library is beyond a few words when using
a specific library.

Also, the code is educational and not meant for production. The focus is on the complexity of the architecture of Generative AI Systems. As such, the code is focused on the functions and not overloaded or drowned in controls. That is for a project, not a prototype. 

*Goal*: Build a GenAISys prototype chapter by chapter and present it in Chapter 10. Thus, comments for beginners are not necessary and can be distractful unless really
necessary to understand the architecture.


## [3.API keys]
The links to the platforms are provided. OpenAI and Pinecone have comprehensive documentation. 
*Goal*: Remain focused on the architecture to upskill the readers on GenAI Systems.

## [4.Copilots]

The author's strategy is to focus on the architecture of complex GenAISys. As such, the architecture was designed first, then the main blocks of code and functions.
When necessary, OpenAI and Gemini were used to fine-tune the functions. The code thus follows the standards these models learned on GitHub and other code repositories.

*Goal*: Remain focused on the architecture of GenAISys.
